## What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed data storage designed for real-time ingestion and processing of streaming data. Data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources—most of which send in data records simultaneously—is referred to as streaming data. This continuous inflow of data must be handled by a streaming platform, which must process the data both incrementally and sequentially.

Three primary purposes are offered by Kafka to its users:
1. Publish and subscribe to streams of records
2. Store records efficiently in the sequence that they were created.
3. Real-time processing of record streams

Building real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that can adjust to the data streams is the main use case for Kafka. It allows for the storing and analysis of both historical and real-time data by combining communications, storage, and stream processing.

## How to run the application (Windows)
1. Start the Zookeeper with the command: .\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties
2. Start the Kafka Server with the command: .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
3. Start up the Producer application
4. Start up the Consumer application
5. Send the request with Bruno/Postman -> You can validate the in the OffsetExplorer, if the message was sent by the Produer to Topic. You'll receive the Logger response of message consumption.
